The goal of the Calibration Admin App is to help the [University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/en/university/) view the individual & group results of the *calibration* assessments they administer in real-time...

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine

2. Open the **calibration_admin.Rproj** file from the directory on your local machine where you cloned this repository. This should install the {renv} package if you do not already have it installed, but if you don't see that happen in the console, run `install.packages("renv")`.

3. Run `renv::restore()` to install the package dependencies needed to run this app successfully

4. Edit the [global.R](global.R) script as necessary (see [below](#app-parameters))

5. Open the [app.R](app.R) file and execute the code in that script to launch the app

### App Parameters

Before a calibration workshop, the [global.R](global.R#L7) script should be edited to define the following parameter for the workshop:

* The [{pins}](https://pins.rstudio.com/) board on RStudio Connect that has been dedicated for this workshop
